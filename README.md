## Security and Privacy

### 100% Safe and Offline
The Motivational Widget is completely safe and contains **no malicious code**. Important privacy features:

- **Fully Offline**: This application never connects to the internet

- **Local Storage Only**: All settings are stored locally on your computer in a simple configuration file
- **Open Source**: The entire codebase is available for review

### About Antivirus Detections

Some antivirus programs may flag the executable as suspicious. These are **false positives** due to several factors:

1. It's a standalone executable created with a Python packager (like PyInstaller)
2. It accesses your file system (to display your images)
3. It uses Windows registry functions for "run at startup" capability
4. It's unsigned (not code-signed with a certificate)

These are common triggers for heuristic-based detection algorithms, especially detection systems like "Tedy" which flag programs based on behavioral patterns rather than actual malicious code.

### Verification Options

If your antivirus flags this application, you have several options:

- **Run from source**: The safest option is to run the Python source code directly
- **Review the code**: Examine what the program actually does
- **Add an exception**: Configure your antivirus to allow this specific application

### Technical Details

The application is built with standard Python libraries and Tkinter for the GUI. It only requires file system access to:
1. Read images from your selected folder
2. Save/load your configuration preferences
3. Create a startup entry if you enable the "Run at Startup" option
